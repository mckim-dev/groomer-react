###Project status Update

--The Demo site only reflects the original single page App. A new link will be provided once the multi-page app code is in better shape. Much work to be done yet.

(Please excuse any messy, unrefactored code. This project is a work in progress and is shared here as such.)

Demo Site Hosted at: https://react-groomer.netlify.app/index.html

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). <br />

Special thanks to: https://placedog.net/ for supplying awesome imagery of dogs free for use as placeholders within web project. <br />

Special thanks to Ray Villalobos for introducing me to Tailwind CSS and providing inspiration for this project via a LinkedIn Course.

# Project Description:

Update: A brief look into development as of March 5, 2022. Documentation will soon be updated to include various new features added, including a Reviews system, registration, pet profiles and additional agile dev bits as I am able to get around to them in my 'pet' project here.

\*This project has been created to practice working within the React Framework and learning Tailwind CSS. The application is a work in progress. It does not have all of the features I would like to add and plan to continue working on.
