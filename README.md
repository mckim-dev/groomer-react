# Project Description:

This project has been created to practice working within the React Framework and learning Tailwind CSS. The application is a work in progress. It does not have all of the features I would like to add and plan to continue working on.

# Current Functionality:

- At present, the application will allow a user to schedule a pet grooming appointment.
- The user may submit the appointment and it will show in the appointment list.
- The user may sort appointments from ascending to descending order, based on the pet's name, the owner's name or the date of the appointment.
