# Project Description:

This project has been created to practice working within the React Framework and learning Tailwind CSS. The application is a work in progress. It does not have all of the features I would like to add and plan to continue working on.

<table align="center"> 
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img align="center" title="Sort Features" width = "750px" 
           src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84540978/153811687-4fd07f1d-3a81-4354-9ecf-ba13b00f2c7f.jpg" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Current Functionality:

- At present, the application will allow a user to schedule a pet grooming appointment.
- The user may submit the appointment and it will show in the appointment list.
- The user may sort appointments from ascending to descending order, based on the pet's name, the owner's name or the date of the appointment.
